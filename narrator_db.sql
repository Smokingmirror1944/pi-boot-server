('scene_campaign_intro','Mission Prologue - To White Forest','Two centuries ago, Terra burned with ambition. Its cityscapes stretched from horizon to horizonâ€”a single, glittering metropolis pulsing with neon and sorcery. Towers of glass and steel clawed at the sky, while orbital elevators stitched Earth to the stars. Humanity believed it had tamed chaos itself. Neural implants offered perfect memory. Arcane reactors hummed with inexhaustible power. Disease and famine were ghosts of the past. \n\nBut arrogance always invites ruin.\n\nThe Rift began as a pinprick of violet lightâ€”a tiny tear in realityâ€™s fabric, hidden deep within a government lab. Scientists called it the Riftgate, a conduit to endless cosmic energy. They thought it a window. It was a door.\n\nThrough that door came the Brood.\n\nA psychic storm tore across Terra. Entire districts fell silent, their inhabitants devoured or remade. The planetary defense network collapsed. The skies were torn open by flashes of biomechanical wings. Humans were seized mid-battle and dragged into the Riftâ€”emerging hours later as hollow-eyed soldiers with glinting neural ports. Their minds were gone, replaced by the Broodâ€™s voice.\n\nWithin three days, humanity lost its world.\n\nThe Hive-Spire rose like a black wound at the heart of City-17â€”a tower of bone and alien alloy. Its walls pulse with psychic energy, broadcasting thoughts that choke human minds into submission. The streets below have become steel tombs where Goliath Walkers prowl and biometric drones hover, scanning for any sign of rebellion.\n\nYet in tunnels and shadows, the Resistance survives. Not an armyâ€”just a whisper. No fortresses or fleetsâ€”only scraps of stolen technology, the will to resist, and the hope of a single artifact that might sever the Broodâ€™s hold.\n\nAnd now, operatives ride a rusting metro train into City-17, their identities hidden behind forged IDs and trembling hope. If they fail, the last chance to close the Rift will vanish. If they succeedâ€¦ Terra might see dawn again.\n\nThe war was lost before it began. But humanity refuses to kneel.\n\nWelcomeâ€¦ to the Shadows of City-17.','Read this at a deliberate, ominous pace. Emphasize the fall from greatness, the cosmic horror, and the crushing weight of the Broodâ€™s occupation. Let this prologue build dread and set expectations: survival is unlikely, victory is impossibleâ€”but defiance still matters.',1),
('scene_intro_train','Metro Train Ride','The world shudders around you as the metro train plunges through endless darkness beneath City-17. Steel wheels scream over rusted tracks, sending vibrations rattling through the carriage walls. The train bucks and groans like a wounded beast. Outside the windows, bolts of violet and electric blue magic spark and dance, igniting shadows in brief, violent flashes. Each arc of energy reveals glimpses of the tunnel wallsâ€”crusted with grime and etched with alien glyphs that shimmer faintly, as though whispering secrets in a language no human should know.\n\nInside, the carriage is a relic of a lost world. Flickering neon strips stutter overhead, buzzing like dying insects. When the lights fail, darkness surges in, swallowing the car whole. In those black moments, the metal groans louder, the rattling of the wheels grows monstrous, and the train seems to become a coffin barreling through an abyss.\n\nRows of passengers sit hunched and silent. Civilian faces, pale and sallow, stare dead-eyed at nothing. Shadows pool beneath their sunken eyes. Their bodies sag beneath stained coats and threadbare tunics. One womanâ€™s hands tremble in her lap, knuckles white against her knees. A man two seats away has a metal compliance implant glinting behind his ear, faint lights pulsing beneath his skin like a heartbeat enslaved to some distant machine.\n\nThe air reeks of sweat, stale smoke, and hot metal. Somewhere overhead, sparks spit from a torn cable, filling the carriage with sharp ozone and flashes of blue light. A thin haze of cigarette smoke clings to the ceiling. Rust stains streak the corners of the floor like old blood. Cracks spiderweb across grimy plastic seatbacks, revealing the rusted metal skeleton beneath. Graffiti is scratched into the panelsâ€”some in Terran script, others in the jagged curves of Brood glyphs. One phrase, scrawled in shaking human letters, reads: â€œTHE BROOD SEES ALL.â€\n\nA battered telescreen flickers in and out of static. When it stabilizes, it shows serene footage of City-17â€™s skyline, all shining towers and orderly crowds. A broken voice croaks from hidden speakers: â€œCompliance ensures safety. The Carbine provides. Compliance ensures safety. The Carbine provides.â€\n\nOccasionally, the train jolts violently. Passengers flinch, gripping filthy handrails, fear flickering in their eyes before itâ€™s swallowed again by resignation. The metal howls in protest as wheels grind against the rails, echoing through the train like tortured screams.\n\nYour hand drifts to your pocket. Your fingers close around a scrap of crumpled paper, edges softened by sweat. You pull it free, shielding it from view, and unfold it under the flickering neon glow. Scrawled across its surface in faded ink are the words:\n\nCodename: â€˜Ravenâ€™\nCodeword: â€˜Isolationâ€™\n\nOne fragile thread tying you to a purpose. Proof that even in this tomb of steel and shadows, hope still flickers. You slide the paper back into your pocket, pulse quickening, eyes scanning the passengers around you. Any one of them might be harmlessâ€”or an informant waiting to raise an alarm.\n\nYour forged ID card sits in your inner coat pocket. Technically valid, but barely. One biometric scan, one suspicious glance, and your mask could crack. The resistance would lose one more soldier. And the Brood would add another voice to their choir of obedience.\n\nOverhead, the intercom crackles to life. The voice is metallic and hollow, distorted by countless layers of encryption and machine modulation:\n\nâ€œCitizens, remain calm. Maintain composure. All travel is subject to security verification. The Carbine ensures your safety.â€\n\nAs the train rattles ever closer to City-17, the neon glare reveals one last scene: across the aisle, a man stares into space, tears cutting clean paths through the grime caked on his cheeks. His neural implant flickers softly. He does not look at you.\n\nNobody speaks. Nobody dares. For in this placeâ€¦ even your thoughts might betray you.','Prompt the players to describe how they are disguised or blending in. Are they wearing factory worker coveralls, civic coats, or scavenged reprocessed uniforms? How are they concealing weapons or contraband? Are they tense, casual, or doing something specific to appear compliant? Encourage players to describe gestures, posture, and body language to deepen immersion.',1),
('scene_arrival_city_view','Arrival in City-17','The metro train slows with a tortured shriek of steel on steel. Sparks spray from the rails outside the windows as brakes clamp down. The lights flicker one last time, then surge to full brightness with a buzz of overloaded circuits. A metallic voice calls over the intercom: â€œPrepare for disembarkation. All passengers will submit to security screening.â€\n\nThe tunnel walls finally open, and the train emerges into a station hollowed into the heart of City-17. Beyond the platformâ€™s edge, the skyline unfolds in a monstrous, alien silhouette.\n\nCity-17 is no longer human.\n\nBlack towers rise like jagged teeth into a sky the color of bruises. The Hive-Spire dominates everythingâ€”a colossal needle of bone-white alloy, its surface rippling with alien glyphs that crawl and shift as if alive. Pulses of violet psychic energy throb along veins running up its walls, radiating a faint glow that reflects off the clouds. Above it, skyward rifts crackle and churn, vomiting arcs of purple lightning that twist across the heavens. Shapes swim behind the rift curtainsâ€”vast, insectoid shadows glimpsed for mere heartbeats before vanishing back into cosmic darkness.\n\nSteel bridges crisscross between skyscrapers, packed with columns of armored Carbine soldiers marching in perfect synchrony. Below, Goliath Walkersâ€”colossal bipedal machines fused with biomechanical sinewâ€”thud along the streets, their turrets swiveling, scanning every crowd. \n\nThe streets themselves are rivers of movement. Citizens shuffle forward in tight formations, heads bowed, eyes blank, each step perfectly aligned to the rhythmic commands booming from propaganda loudspeakers. Civil Protection drones hover overhead, red scanning lasers sweeping left and right like hunting predators.\n\nPropaganda banners hang from towers, bearing stylized glyphs and slogans: â€œHarmony Through Unity,â€ â€œThe Carbine Provides,â€ â€œCompliance Ensures Survival.â€ Flickering telescreens embedded in the architecture display the serene face of Dr. Elias Breen, City-17â€™s puppet governor, delivering calm assurances in a voice that resonates with the subtle, hypnotic cadence of psychic influence.\n\nThe train doors hiss open with a gust of sour, recycled air. Cold neon spills into the carriage, casting harsh light on the waiting platform. Brood Enforcers stand there in perfect stillness, black visors glowing with red light, shock batons crackling faintly in their fists. A low, pulsing vibration rises in the floorâ€”an inaudible psychic thrum that makes your skull ache, as if the Hive-Spire itself were watching and thinking.\n\nAhead lies the station exitâ€”and the first checkpoint.','Describe the **scale** and **alien nature** of City-17. Make the players feel small and hunted. Reinforce that the city is alive, shifting, and dangerous. Encourage the players to react emotionally to the sight of the Hive-Spire. Do they feel fear, anger, resignation? Use their responses to shape how they enter the checkpoint scene.',1),
('scene_blending_in_success','Blending In - Success','The train doors slide open with a hydraulic hiss, releasing a wave of stale air into the neon-lit station. Around you, the sea of passengers rises in silence, moving as one mass of bowed heads and shuffling feet. You slip into their flow, shoulders hunched, eyes low, breathing measured.\n\nYour forged ID sits heavy in your pocket. You avoid the gaze of the Brood Enforcers stationed along the platform. They stand immobile, faces hidden behind red-lit visors. The thrum of their neural scanners cuts through the station like an electric blade. One of them tilts its helmet slightly, the crimson glow sweeping over your formâ€”and then moving on, apparently satisfied.\n\nPropaganda screens overhead flicker to life, showing Dr. Elias Breenâ€™s pale, tranquil face. His voice drifts through the cavernous space, a smooth, well-rehearsed performance:\n\nâ€œWelcome. Welcome to City-17. You have chosen, or been chosen, to relocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers. I thought so much of City-17 that I elected to establishâ€¦ my administration here, in the Citadel so thoughtfully provided byâ€¦ our benefactors. I have been proud to call City-17 my home. And so, whether you are here to stay, or passing through on your way to parts unknownâ€¦ welcome to City-17.â€\n\nYou keep your head lowered as you shuffle toward the exit barriers. A flickering scanner passes over your group, projecting shimmering grids of light across your faces and torsos. It chirps twice, then falls silent. Green glyphs flicker on its surface, signaling safe passage.\n\nYouâ€™ve slipped through. For now, you are just another piece of the machine.\n\nBeyond the security archways, the roar of the city grows louderâ€”a thunderous mix of marching boots, distant explosions, and the psychic pulse emanating from the Hive-Spire like a migraine lodged behind your eyes.\n\nYou sense that somewhere beyond these walls, your contact waits: Raven. And City-17 itself seems to lean closer, listening.','Play up the relief and tension. Even though they succeeded, the danger hasnâ€™t passed. Let players decide if they head immediately for Ravenâ€™s rendezvous or linger to gather intel. Allow short scenes for roleplay if desired.',1),
('scene_blending_in_failure_flagged','Blending In - Flagged for Scrutiny','The train doors hiss open, and the passengers begin filing off in heavy silence. You try to slip into the flow, but your movements draw a flicker of attention. A Brood Enforcer, towering in matte-black armor, lifts one gloved hand and speaks in a voice like crushed metal:\n\nâ€œHold there. Stand straight, citizen.â€\n\nIts crimson visor sweeps over your group, scanning from head to foot. Static crackles from its helmet as the neural scanner buzzes to life. A row of green glyphs flickers across its chest plateâ€¦ then suddenly stutters, showing a pulsing amber glow.\n\nAnother Enforcer steps closer, shock baton humming with stored energy. Passengers around you keep moving, their eyes fixed to the floor, desperate not to be associated with whatever is happening.\n\nThe Enforcer speaks again, voice flat and echoing:\n\nâ€œPrepare for secondary biometric inspection. Any deviation will result in immediate disciplinary action.â€\n\nSomewhere above, propaganda speakers churn out the same gentle voice of Dr. Breen:\n\nâ€œRemember, compliance is safety. Resistance only prolongs suffering. The Carbine provides.â€\n\nYour heart thunders in your chest. The platform feels narrower. The Hive-Spire pulses in the distance like a heartbeat rattling the station walls.','Players can attempt new checks to talk or bluff their way out, or plan an escape. Tension should be extremely high. This scene sets up either a stealth solution or potential combat. Emphasize how citizens avoid eye contact and how isolation can become deadly.',1),
('scene_blending_in_failure_blow_cover','Blending In - Cover Blown','The moment the train doors open, everything goes wrong.

Resistance personnel hurry back and forth, shouting over static-filled radios, their faces lit by flickering readouts. In the center of the room stands a towering circular platform bathed in blue light. At its heart rests a containment cradleâ€”a curved steel harness lined with arcane filaments pulsing in sync with the Hive-Spireâ€™s distant rhythm.\n\nRaven sets the Artifact into the cradle. Instantly, it reacts, sending pulses of ultraviolet light shooting across the room. Arcane glyphs blossom in midair around the shard, spiraling like orbiting satellites. Technicians shield their eyes as consoles flare with alarms.\n\nOne technician calls out:\n\nâ€œEnergy readings off the scale! Itâ€™s resonating with the Riftâ€™s psychic frequency!â€\n\nRavenâ€™s eyes narrow. â€œExactly what we need.â€\n\nThe Resistance Officer steps forward, a grim line drawn across her face.\n\nâ€œListen carefully. Once this thingâ€™s in the warhead, we fire it into the Rift. If it detonates correctly, the psychic tether should collapse. The Broodâ€™s entire network will lose connection to this plane. But if we failâ€¦ the backlash could fry every neural network from here to the Arctic.â€\n\nRaven glances at the screens, jaw set.\n\nâ€œAnd they know weâ€™re here. Weâ€™ve intercepted Brood comms. Heavy units en route. Goliath Walkers. Gunships. Possibly the Hive-Spireâ€™s psychic strike force.â€\n\nThe Officer snaps her fingers. â€œWe have to buy time. I need power routed to the launch gantry, encryption on the targeting array, and physical defenses at the silo doors.â€\n\nShe looks to you all.\n\nâ€œChoose. Help with tech systems, hold the line outside, or guard the control chamber. Your actions will decide if we live to see dawn.â€\n\nAround you, resistance techs scramble between control stations. Sparks fly from overloaded consoles. Distant explosions echo through the complex as enemy forces test White Forestâ€™s outer defenses. The glow of the Artifact pulses faster, casting shadows across the chamber walls like writhing tentacles of light.\n\nThe fate of Terra balances on a razorâ€™s edge.','This is a critical decision point. Let players choose between:\n\n- Assisting with magical or technological systems (Arcana, Technology checks)\n- Fighting on the front line against incoming Brood forces\n- Defending the control chamber from infiltration\n\nThe playersâ€™ choices shape whether the launch sequence succeeds smoothly or becomes a chaotic final stand. Offer rolls to influence progress timers, mitigate disasters, or uncover last-minute sabotage. Emphasize tension and urgency.',1),
('scene_white_forest_launch_sequence','White Forest Launch Sequence','The chamber rocks as another distant explosion shakes the foundations of White Forest. Dust rains down from concrete beams. Sirens scream overhead in pulsing tones. Technicians rush between consoles, their faces pale under flashing red emergency lights.\n\nThe Artifact glows like a miniature sun in its cradle. Streams of violet and ultraviolet light spiral upward into twisting glyphs, projecting shifting shadows across the chamber walls. Each pulse of light thrums in perfect time with the psychic resonance of the Hive-Spire, as though the two are locked in a cosmic conversation.\n\nRaven stands at a console, fingers flying over glowing touchpads. Sparks burst from overloaded circuits. A voice crackles through nearby speakers:\n\nâ€œOuter doors breached! Goliath Walkers inbound! Weâ€™re down to emergency power!â€\n\nThe Resistance Officer shouts:\n\nâ€œLock the blast doors! Reroute power to the missile lifts!â€\n\nA technician screams from another console:\n\nâ€œTheyâ€™re hacking the launch sequence! Brood signals flooding the grid!â€\n\nRaven spins to you, eyes blazing:\n\nâ€œHelp me override the encryptionâ€”or weâ€™re firing this warhead into the ocean instead of the Rift!â€\n\nBrood Enforcers burst into the chamber entrance, weapons blazing. Plasma bolts slice through the air, searing white-hot trails into consoles and walls. Sparks shower the floor as metal explodes under the impacts. Resistance fighters return fire, hunkering behind overturned tables.\n\nManhacks swirl through the chaos, blades whirring. Red targeting lasers sweep over your group. The psychic thrum in your skull grows unbearable, as if the Hive-Spire itself is screaming.\n\nAbove the roar of gunfire, the Artifactâ€™s glow intensifies. It sings in a high, pure note, filling the air with dazzling light. A ripple of psychic force hammers outward, sending loose papers flying and glass panels shattering.\n\nRaven grips your shoulder, voice hoarse:\n\nâ€œThis is our moment! Either we launchâ€”\n\nâ€”or we die here.â€','This scene is both combat and high-stakes skill challenge. Players can:\n\n- Fight enemies in the chamber\n- Attempt skill checks to finalize the launch\n- Protect Raven as they complete critical tasks\n\nAdjust the pacing for maximum tension. Keep the sense of chaos and danger. If the launch fails, White Forest may fall entirelyâ€”but even a partial success can change the story. Allow big hero moments, sacrifice scenes, and powerful final actions.',1),
('scene_white_forest_launch_success','White Forest Launch - Success','Raven slams the final sequence into the console, eyes blazing with a mix of triumph and desperation. Lights surge across the chamber, every screen turning brilliant white. The Artifact flares so brightly itâ€™s impossible to look at directly. Its glow explodes outward in a shockwave of indigo and violet, rippling through the walls like liquid light.\n\nThe holographic map above the console spins and locks onto the Riftâ€™s coordinates. Targeting glyphs converge into a single piercing point. A countdown pulses on every monitor:\n\n5â€¦ 4â€¦ 3â€¦\n\nOutside, the rumble of Goliath Walkers thunders against blast doors. Resistance fighters roar defiance, firing volley after volley into advancing Brood troops.\n\n2â€¦\n\nRaven grabs your arm, eyes fierce. â€œBrace yourself!â€\n\n1â€¦\n\nWith a roar that splits the air, the missile silo beneath your feet shakes as an ancient launch mechanism comes to life. Pistons slam upward, propelling a sleek missile toward a retracting roof high overhead. Flame and fury erupt from the silo mouth, a pillar of fire roaring upward.\n\nOn the main screen, a camera feed tracks the missile rising into the bruised sky. Its contrail glows like a blade of violet fire. It curves toward the seething Rift, where purple lightning churns through cosmic wounds.\n\nA heartbeat later, the Artifact detonates inside the Rift in a silent burst of psychic brilliance. The Rift thrashes, folding inward as arcs of lightning twist into spirals. Glyphs race across the Riftâ€™s surface like panic-stricken creatures, then vanish one by one. The psychic pressure pressing on your skull evaporates like fog under sunlight.\n\nOutside, Brood forces stagger. Drones drop lifeless from the air. Enforcers clutch at their helmets as crimson lights flicker and die. Even the Hive-Spire itself wavers, its glow dimming as if it suddenly forgot why it was alive.\n\nSilence settles over White Forest, punctuated only by the ragged breathing of survivors. Raven lowers their weapon, trembling.\n\nâ€œItâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s closing. The Riftâ€™s closing.â€\n\nThe Resistance Officer looks around the chamber, face streaked with dirt and tears. â€œWe mightâ€¦ we might have just won.â€\n\nAbove, the Rift shrinks to a narrow seam of violet lightâ€”and finally snaps shut like a wound healed. Darkness settles over City-17, broken only by the pale neon glow of towers slowly flickering back to life. The Hive-Spire quiversâ€”and begins to fracture.\n\nRaven turns to you, eyes glinting with fierce hope.\n\nâ€œWhite Forest stands. And Terraâ€¦ still breathes.â€','This is a cinematic victory scene. Let players celebrate, share reactions, or mourn fallen comrades. Raven may offer heartfelt thanks or glimpses of what rebuilding might look like. The campaign may either close here as a bittersweet victoryâ€”or continue with fallout missions if desired.',1),
('scene_white_forest_launch_failure','White Forest Launch - Failure','Alarms scream in a rising wail. Sparks rain from overhead conduits. Raven curses under their breath as a red error glyph blooms across the main console:\n\n> TARGETING COORDINATES CORRUPTED\n> ARTIFACT OVERLOAD IMMINENT\n\nThe Artifact convulses in its cradle, radiating searing waves of violet light. Fractures spiderweb across its crystalline surface. A shrill psychic keening floods your skull, drowning out every other sound.\n\nTechnicians stagger back, clutching their heads as blood seeps from their noses. The Resistance Officer pounds a fist against a console:\n\nâ€œShut it down! Shut it down!â€\n\nRaven shouts, voice ragged:\n\nâ€œI canâ€™t! Itâ€™s feeding on the Riftâ€™s resonance! If we abort now, itâ€™ll blow and take White Forest with it!â€\n\nOutside the chamber, an explosion rips through the complex. Sections of ceiling collapse as chunks of concrete and twisted rebar crash to the floor. Goliath Walkers pound ever closer, their footfalls shaking the silo like an earthquake.\n\nThe holographic map flickers and distorts. The Rift on-screen ripples violently, expanding outward instead of closing. Dark glyphs spin across its surface like a vortex of madness.\n\nRaven makes one last attempt at the console, fingers flying over cracked keys. The Artifact emits a final, piercing scream. Then it shattersâ€”exploding into a storm of violet shards and psychic shockwaves.\n\nA wave of force slams through the chamber, hurling bodies across consoles. Glass shatters. Sparks erupt. The psychic pressure bursts into raw agony, stabbing into your thoughts. For an instant, alien visions flood your mindâ€”towering shapes in impossible geometries, endless corridors spiraling into darkness, and the whispered certainty that the Brood is eternal.\n\nWhen the shockwave fades, silence falls. Smoke coils through the chamber, lit by dying embers. The Artifact is gone. The Hive-Spire still stands in the distance, pulsing stronger than ever.\n\nRaven drags themselves upright, blood streaking their brow, eyes haunted.\n\nâ€œWe failed. The Riftâ€¦ itâ€™s growing.â€\n\nOutside, Brood forces roar as they surge forward. Gunfire rattles closer and closer. The Resistance Officer locks eyes with you, jaw clenched in grim finality.\n\nâ€œFall back. All unitsâ€”fall back to secondary positions!â€\n\nRaven grips your arm, voice shaking.\n\nâ€œThis isnâ€™t over. Weâ€™ll find another way.â€\n\nBut as you look up at the Hive-Spire looming above, glowing brighter than ever, a sick certainty settles in your gut: The Brood is coming. And Terraâ€™s nightmare has only deepened.','This scene is dark, tragic, and sets up future arcs where the fight continues. Allow players to react emotionally, decide how they retreat, or attempt last-ditch heroics. Emphasize Ravenâ€™s resolve that this isnâ€™t the end.

('scene_post_launch_victory','Post-Launch Fallout - Victory','Hours pass under flickering lights in White Forest. The air remains thick with smoke and the tang of scorched metal, but the alarms have finally gone silent. Outside, dawn begins to break over City-17, spilling pale gold across the sky. The Hive-Spire, once pulsing with malevolent light, lies fractured on the horizon, split into leaning shards of alien alloy. Faint lightning still dances among the Riftâ€™s dying edgesâ€”but itâ€™s fading, slowly being swallowed by the skyâ€™s natural blue.\n\nInside the command chamber, resistance fighters patch wounds, drag twisted metal from doorways, and offer each other silent nods of weary relief. Some stare blankly at consoles still flickering with residual error messages. A few weep openly, shoulders shaking with the release of years of terror.\n\nRaven stands beside you, arms crossed, eyes locked on the distant skyline. The rising sun gleams across the scratches and bruises marking their face. For the first time since you met, Raven actually smilesâ€”a small, tired curve of lips, but genuine.\n\nâ€œWe did it,â€ they murmur. â€œThe Riftâ€™s gone. Theyâ€™ve lost their hold on Terra.â€\n\nThe Resistance Officer steps forward, her voice firm though hoarse from hours of shouting commands:\n\nâ€œCarbine units are in chaos. Brood signals have collapsed across multiple cities. Weâ€™re getting reports of Goliath Walkers shutting down mid-stride. Citizens are fighting back.â€\n\nShe clasps your hand firmly.\n\nâ€œYouâ€™ve saved millions. Maybe the entire species.â€\n\nOutside, distant cheers rise across City-17 as word begins to spread. Citizens emerge cautiously from hiding, eyes wide as they stare at the Hive-Spireâ€™s shattered remains. Neon lights flicker back on, illuminating streets that no longer feel entirely owned by monsters.\n\nRaven glances at you again, voice quiet.\n\nâ€œThis warâ€™s not over. Thereâ€™ll be cleanup, hunting down stragglers. And the scars wonâ€™t heal fast. But for the first time in yearsâ€¦ we get to decide what comes next.â€\n\nThey extend a hand toward you.\n\nâ€œSo. Want to help rebuild the world?â€','This is a hopeful epilogue. Let players roleplay conversations with Raven and other survivors. Offer closure or hints about future missions.

('scene_post_launch_failure','Post-Launch Fallout - Failure','Smoke coils through White Forestâ€™s corridors like a living creature. Emergency lights flash in broken pulses, revealing corridors choked with debris and bodies. The Hive-Spire looms larger than ever on the skyline aboveâ€”a monstrous fang of alien alloy pulsing with renewed psychic brilliance. Violet lightning flickers across its surface, dancing like veins through dark glass.\n\nThe command chamber lies in shambles. Consoles sparked and burned during the Artifactâ€™s overload. Resistance fighters drag injured comrades away on makeshift stretchers. Blood streaks the floor. The air is hot, stinking of ozone, charred electronics, and the iron tang of spilled blood.\n\nRaven sits slumped against a blast wall, eyes hollow. They stare into the middle distance as if trying to remember how hope once felt.\n\nâ€œIt was right there,â€ they whisper. â€œWe almost had it.â€\n\nThe Resistance Officer staggers over, a deep gash crossing her cheek. She wipes blood from her eyes and grips Ravenâ€™s shoulder.\n\nâ€œSnap out of it. This isnâ€™t over. The Broodâ€™s pressing in on every front. We fall back to the old tunnels. We regroup. We hit them again.â€\n\nShe turns to you, voice low but burning with defiance.\n\nâ€œYouâ€™re still resistance. Youâ€™ve proven that. And Terraâ€™s not dead yet.â€\n\nOutside, the Hive-Spire pulses with even brighter psychic radiance. Its glow bleeds down the skyline, illuminating the ruins of City-17 in unnatural violet light. Distant roars echo across the cityâ€”throaty, monstrous howls that donâ€™t sound entirely human.\n\nOne last console sparks to life. A message scrolls across the screen in crimson glyphs:\n\n> RIFT EXPANSION INITIATED\n> CONSOLIDATION PROTOCOL ALPHA\n> ALL HIVE UNITS DEPLOY\n\nRaven pushes to their feet, grim determination returning.\n\nâ€œIf they want war,â€ Raven growls, eyes flaring, â€œthen we give them war.â€\n\nThe Resistance Officer squares her shoulders.\n\nâ€œGather what you can. We leave in ten. The fightâ€™s not over. Not while one of us still breathes.â€\n\nFar above, the Hive-Spire screams psychic static into the night, as Terra plunges into its next chapter of darkness.','Lean into tragedy and defiance.
